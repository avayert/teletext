teletext
========

This is a hobby project I worked on as I saw that Unicode added teletext drawing
characters to their character set. I knew the Finnish Broadcasting Company
(YLE) had a public-facing teletext API, and had previously wanted to work on
this project, but braille and box building characters present in Unicode at the
time were not sufficient to draw most of the pages.

The program is woefully incomplete, as it does not currently fetch data
real-time, but rather is only the drawing logic.

I ran into issues with terminal features regarding double height/width text,
and blinks, which made me want to rewrite the project as a fully-fledged GUI.


Here are a few screenshots demonstrating what it looks like:
